# Nasa-Global-Landslide-Catalog-Analysis

The initial purpose of this dataset was to investigate global rainfall triggered landslides
and events. Building on this goal, we conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses
to identify additional correlations within the data. Our objective expanded to include leveraging
the entire dataset to uncover trends and patterns that could help predict future landslide events.
Using standard analytical methods such as correlation, time series analysis, clustering, and
regression, we found minimal associations between most dataset columns. However, a moderate
correlation was identified between rainfall triggers and landslide types, suggesting that the
category of a landslide could potentially be predicted based on the characteristics of upcoming
rainfall events.
